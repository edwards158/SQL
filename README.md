# SQL
SQL based Notebooks

This repository contains some of my work using SQL.  The notebooks are experiments, 
courses, kaggle entries, hacks and code ideas from various sources.  The work was done using SQLite but mostly PostgreSQL.  Some of the notebooks are for my own benefit so I can recall the basics of the language in a handy location.  Some references are:
