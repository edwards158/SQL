# SQL
SQL based Notebooks

This repository contains some of my work using SQL.  The notebooks are experiments, 
courses, kaggle entries, hacks and code ideas from various sources.  The work was done using SQLite and mostly PostgreSQL.  Use the pfAdmin tool allied with ipython magics to carry out the work.  Some references are:
